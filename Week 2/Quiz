1. What is the difference between if and else-if?
   if checks the first condition.
   else if checks another condition if the first is false.

2. When is a switch statement preferred over multiple if-else statements?
   When checking one variable against many possible values.

3. Predict the output of the code using break inside a loop
   break exits the loop completely when it runs.

4. Difference between while and do-while loops
   while checks the condition first.
   do-while runs once, then checks the condition.

5. What happens if the continue is executed inside a loop?
  It skips to the next loop iteration, ignoring the code after continue.
